"Proximal operator for the total variation denoising penalty

    Requires scikit-image be installed

    Parameters
    ----------
    x0 : array_like
        The starting or initial point used in the proximal update step

    rho : float
        Momentum parameter for the proximal step (larger value -> stays closer to x0)

    gamma : float
        A constant that weights how strongly to enforce the constraint

    Returns
    -------
    theta : array_like
        The parameter vector found after running the proximal update step

    Raises
    ------

"Segment-wise dot product.

    This function calculates the dot product of x2d with each trial of x3d.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x2d : array, shape (p, m)
        Input argument.
    x3d : array, shape (t, m, n)
        Segmented input data with t trials, m signals, and n samples. The dot
        product with x2d is calculated for each trial.

    Returns
    -------
    out : array, shape (t, p, n)
        Dot product of x2d with each trial of x3d.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.random.randn(6, 40, 150)
    >>> a = np.ones((7, 40))
    >>> y = dot_special(a, x)
